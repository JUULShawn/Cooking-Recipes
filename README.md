# Cooking Recipes 

A curated list of cooking recipes. Mostly in italian, a few in english. All in metric (no friggin' cups and ounces...). 

All have been collected over the years from the Net, relatives, mum and personal experimentation. Credit is given when remembered (and if you see a recipe of yours and want it credited/removed do contact me and I'll act as soon as I can).
